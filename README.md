# AI and Software Engineering
## Software Engineering - Exercise 0

[Reference to Article](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/will-ai-replace-software-engineers "Will AI Replace Software Engineers")

I've recently had discussions with friends and family when mentioning how I'll be taking this software engineering course, and there was a common thread among the conversations that **<span style="color:red">AI</span>** will destroy the profession. The article I look into explores the impact of AI on the software engineering profession, highlighting both the concerns and opportunities it presents. It admits that, on one hand, there's a growing apprehension among developers regarding AI's potential to automate tasks traditionally performed by humans, raising fears about job security and skill obsolescence, citing routine and repetitive roles like coding and data entry as the first on the chopping board. Conversely, the article still emphasizes the positive aspects of AI integration, noting its capacity to enhance efficiency, improve code quality, and foster innovation by freeing up human developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks. It suggests that rather than viewing AI as a threat, developers should see it as a complementary tool that can augment their skills and productivity.

Not to mention, the article resonates with another of my beliefs on our duties as engineers to adapt to rather than resist our tools. I personally believe classes shouldn't be banning coding assistants out of fear of plagiarism, but should instead promote a proficiency in utilizing current tools where they shine. The article similarly underscores the importance of adaptation and continuous learning for software engineers in this evolving landscape. It encourages embracing AI and developing relevant skills in machine learning, data science, and cybersecurity to stay competitive. Ultimately, the article advocates for a balanced perspective, recognizing AI's transformative potential in software engineering while also acknowledging the imperative for developers to evolve alongside technological advancements to secure their place in the future of the industry.

### Added Peer Thoughts:

- (Firas Darwish) I was also concerned about the extent to which automation thwart the utility of learning certain software engineering skills, especially seeing as we have a broad understanding of effective software engineering as the creation of a one-size fits all approach (rather than the tailored, customized approach that AI may not be able to generalize). I find it interesting how the article notes that software engineers with skills in machine learning, data science, etc. are 'protected' from AI; however, this doesn't draw a fine enough distinction between ML Engineers, DevOps, Data Scientists, etc. and Machine Learning researchers where the former's job could--in some sense--be replaced by AI systems while the latter deals directly with the design and synthesis of AI algorithms.
